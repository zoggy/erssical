<section id="eventrss" title="Event RSS Channels ?">
<p>
The <ext-a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html/">RSS 2.0 specification</ext-a>
allows adding information in RSS feeds, in a simple way: just add XML nodes with a
namespace.
</p>
<p>
This extension possibility is used in Erssical to handle additional information relative
to events, initially to share software developer events. This additional information
consists in:
</p>
<ul>
<li>the intended audience (a string),</li>
<li>the type of event (conference, course, ...),</li>
<li>some keywords (a list of strings),</li>
<li>the speakers (a list of strings),</li>
<li>the organizers (a list of strings),</li>
<li>the start date and hour,</li>
<li>the end date and hour,</li>
<li>the "level" of the audience (beginner, confirmed, expert, ...).</li>
</ul>
<p>All fields are optional. The details of the XML representation of this
information is given on <page href="doc-event"/>.
</p>

</section>

<section id="queries" title="Queries">
<p>A query is composed of:</p>
<ul>
<li>a mime-type specifying what to output,</li>
<li>a list of source RSS channels,</li>
<li>an optional target channel,</li>
<li>an optional filter.</li>
</ul>
<p>A query is described in XML. An example of query is available
<ext-a href="https://raw.github.com/zoggy/erssical/master/tests/query.xml">here</ext-a>.
</p>
<p>The details of the XML representation of a query is given on <page href="doc-query"/>.</p>
</section>

<section id="exec" title="Executing queries">
<p>
When given a query, Erssical performs the following operations:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Fetch the source RSS channels given with a URL (
  as source channels can also be embedded in the query);
  each fetched channel can have default event information specified;
  in this case, the event information of each item of the channel is
  merged with the default information. For example, default keywords
  are added to all items of a channel.
</li>
<li>Merge the items of all source channels into a new channel. Description
  (title, descrption, image, ...) of this new channel is the same as the first
  source channel, except if a target channel was specified in the query.
</li>
<li>If a filter was given, only the items of this new channel matching
  the filter are kept.
</li>
<li>Depending of the output format specified, output the resulting RSS channel
  or the calendar data in Ical format.
</li>
</ol>

<section id="run" title="Command line tool or server">
<p>
Erssical comes with a command line tool, <code>erssical</code>, and
a HTTP server, <code>erssical-http</code>.
</p>
<p>
The command line tool will typically be used when generating static contents
for your web site, while the HTTP server will be useful to dynamically
merge information to embed in a web page. See
<page href="doc-erssical"/> and <page href="doc-erssical-http"/> for more
information.
