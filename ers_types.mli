(** {2 Queries}

A query is composed of source RSS channels, an optional target RSS channel and
an optional filter.
The sources and the optional target will merged, then the filter will be
be applied on the merge result to keep only selected items.

If the source if indicated with a url, additional event information
can be specified for this source. In this case, this
information is used to complete the event information of each item of
the source channel. A typical example is to add default keywords for all
items of a source channel.

The target channel is used as base channel: all its information (title,
link, description, ...) is kept (except items which are processed as described
above).

If no target channel is given, then the first source is used as base channel.
If no source and no target is given, this is considered as an error.

The structure to compute is indicated by the "type" attribute of the
"<query>" top node of the query XML document. "type" can be:
- ["application/rss+xml"] to indicate that computing the query will return
  a new Event RSS containing (eventually filtered) items,
- ["text/calendar"] to indicate that the merged channel must be converted to
  the Ical format.
*)

(** A source can be a channel given directly in a [<source>] node, or
  it can be a URL, given in the "href" attribute of the [<source>] node.
  In the latter case, the channel will be fetched
  from this URL (using Curl library).
*)

  information, i.e. text information, for example errors encountered while
